# Credit-card-defaulters-prediction
The credit card default dataset gives information about the payment records, demographic factors, and, bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

The dataset aims to determine whether the customer will be a defaulter in the next month based on the various predictive analysis. 23 features related to a customer influence the decision of them making a payment in the next month. There are two classes in the target variable "default payment next month"; 1 denotes that the person will be in default the following month, and 0 denotes the opposite. 

The ordinal measures that indicate the payment delay in months are displayed in the columns "PAY_0," "PAY_1," etcetera. “BILL_AMT” shows the bill statement of a particular month. The amount paid in a given month is displayed in the column "PAY_AMT". Similarly, Age, Marriage, and other nominal features have a major effect on the analysis.
